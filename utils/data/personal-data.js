  description: "I’m Viren Patil, a software engineer who recently graduated with an MS in Computer Science from USC. I’m drawn to work that sits at the intersection of engineering and AI, and most of my projects reflect that. Over the past few years, I’ve built a collaborative movie watchlist app, an ephemeral encrypted chat platform, and several AI driven systems spanning large language models, multimodal video analysis, and automated sports commentary. I’ve also explored blockchain, data engineering, and cloud infrastructure, which has helped me develop a broad, practical toolkit for solving problems across different domains. What motivates me most is taking ambitious ideas and shaping them into thoughtful, reliable tools that people genuinely enjoy using.",
