  description: "I’m Viren Patil, a software engineer and MSCS student at USC with a strong interest in building products that bring AI and engineering together. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from a collaborative movie watchlist app and an ephemeral encrypted chat platform to research in large language models, multimodal video analysis, and AI-powered sports commentary. I also have experience with blockchain applications, data engineering, and cloud infrastructure, which has given me a broad toolkit for solving problems across different domains. What excites me most is the process of turning ambitious ideas into well-crafted, practical tools that people actually enjoy using.",
