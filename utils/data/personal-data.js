  description: "I am Viren Patil, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, set to graduate in May 2025. My passion lies in building innovative solutions, whether through coding or other creative avenues. I thrive on the challenge of debugging and have recently delved into the realm of large language models (LLMs) to discover optimal applications for pre-trained models. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy watching movies and playing games on my PC. When faced with a roadblock in my projects, I find that a hot shower often provides the relaxation and clarity needed to approach problems from a fresh perspective.",
